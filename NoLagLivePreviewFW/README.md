NoLagLivePreviewFW
==================

Attempt to make a firmware for the HERO3 Black with no lag in preview.

In the GoPro OpenSource page, there is a reference to “live.2012.02.04.tar”, an outdated version of LIVE555 Stream system.

I got the newer version of Live, the “live.2013.12.31.tar”, and I also got the firmware for the HERO3 Black. 
My idea is to replace the outdated version to the new version.
Please help me, this is opensource!

I contacted LIVE555 to ask why the lag, they told me GoPro is using an outdated version.
Then I contacted GoPro telling them to update the live version, it seems that the HERO3+ camera uses the last live version (nearly no lag)

You can get the [outdated version of live, what GoPro HERO3 and below uses](https://github.com/KonradIT/UnofficialGoProFW/blob/master/NoLagLivePreviewFW/live.2012.02.04.tar) and [the most recent version, what the HERO3+ uses](https://github.com/KonradIT/UnofficialGoProFW/blob/master/NoLagLivePreviewFW/live.2013.12.31.tar)

I included here the firmware of the HERO3 Black, the camera that I will try to fix.

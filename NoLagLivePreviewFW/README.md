NoLagLivePreviewFW
==================

Attemp to make a firmware fo the HERO3 Black with no lag in preview.

In the GoPro OpenSource page, there is a reference to “live.2012.02.04.tar”, an outdated version of LIVE555 Stream system.

I got the newer vesrion of Live, the “live.2013.12.31.tar”, and I also got the firmware for the HERO3 Black. 
My idea is to replace the outdated version to the new version.
Please help me, this is opensource!
